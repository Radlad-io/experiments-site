        info="This was an open source FDM 3d printer design that I was working on for fun. At the time open source machines all seemed to prioritize low cost which presented quality issues. This machine was being designed as a middle ground between high end machines and low cost machines. A surge of new 3d printer companies caused me to halt this project. Valuable experience in CAD was gained."
